# Hack in eu [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) 

Website live: https://hack-in-eu.netlify.com

I couldn't find an updated list of hackathons in europe (or a working website) so I decided to make my own.

Feel free to add an hackathon doing a pull request (edit [./src/data/hacks.json](./src/data/hacks.json))

This is a MVP and a work in progress, eventually I may move to an actual database, but for now this is the easiest way that allows people to add new hackathons from day 0.
